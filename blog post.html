        <h2>how it all began</h2>
        <p>
            A few months ago, I had no idea how websites were built. I used to think
            it was something only professionals could do. But after learning HTML,
            I realized how fun and creative it can be!

        <h3>Learning HTML Basics</h3>
        <p>
            I started with understanding basic tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. These tags help structure the content on a webpage.
            Once I got the hang of it, I moved on to images, links, and even formatting text.

        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>

            web development. I am excited to continue learning html ,CSS and JavaScript next!</P>
